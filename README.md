## üß† A decentralized behavioral analysis and prediction engine.

Built to help $TAO investors take decisive action by connecting behavioral signals across the Bittensor network to likely future outcomes. Patrol aims to become the trust and predictive engine for decentralized networks ‚Äî combining deep historical analysis with forward-looking insight to power smarter decisions across the ecosystem.

---

## üîç From Behavior to Insight

Patrol turns raw on-chain activity into forward-looking insight through a structured process we call the **Predictive Intelligence Loop** ‚Äî a reusable pattern found across the Bittensor network.

1. **Observe Behavior**  
   Track wallet actions: emissions, transfers, staking, swaps, etc.

2. **Model Actors & Environments**  
   Identify patterns and personas (e.g. dumpers, holders, flip traders) and map how they shape subnet dynamics.

3. **Generate Predictions**  
   Forecast likely outcomes: outflows, instability, accumulation, or price impact.

Each layer sharpens the next. By connecting actions to intent and intent to environment, Patrol helps users understand not just what happened ‚Äî but what's likely next.

## üß™ Task Types

Patrol supports three categories of mining tasks ‚Äî each offering a distinct lens on behavior and contributing to a fuller understanding of the network:

1. **Historical Pattern Analysis**  
   **Status:** Not Yet Available  
   Miners identify and label behaviors that have already occurred ‚Äî such as emission dumping, alpha hoarding, validator churn, or cold key swaps. These signatures help define the behavioral history of wallets and subnets.

2. **Predictive Forecasting**  
   **Status:** Live  
   Miners will analyze recent activity to forecast what might happen next ‚Äî projecting sell pressure, anticipating post-ownership actions, or detecting early signs of rising risk.

3. **LLM-Based Chain Reasoning**  
   **Status:** Not Yet Available  
   Future tasks will leverage large language models to interpret patterns, answer open-ended questions, and generate human-readable explanations of complex behaviors.

Each task type builds on the last ‚Äî from raw observation to interpretation to predictive insight.

## Accessing Patrol's Data
In the near future we plan to provide a Public API for developers interested in consuming the data collected by the Patrol subnet.

## Documentation and Resources

Documentation on how each task works and is scored can be found in the Mining Guide.
